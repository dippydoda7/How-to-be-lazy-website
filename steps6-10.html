        				<h1>Step 6</h1>
        			    
        			 <p>Shop less. Less shopping gives you more time to be doing enjoyable things, like spending time with your friends, spouse, or kids, or hanging around the beach. Have a list, a plan, and do your shopping only when needed. And spending less means you acquire less, so then you own less, which means you have less to maintain and clean, and you're in better financial shape without the clutter. How's that for laziness?<p>
					    <h1>Step 7</h1> 
					      <p>Allow yourself weekend lie-ins. There is a lot of sleep research about that suggests regular sleep patterns are important to maintain, so sudden changes to your sleeping habits are not recommended. However, a lie-in is not about sleeping; it is about staying in bed and indulging yourself. Read a good book, eat breakfast in bed, draw in bed, or do anything you fancy while simply chilling out in bed.<p>
					     <h1>Step 8</h1>
					     <p>Just put your feet up. If you’ve had a long day, or you just feel like sitting there doing nothing, do it with pride. Sit out on your porch, in front of the television, or just wherever you feel the most comfortable, put your feet up, lean back, and enjoy the sensation of doing absolutely nothing. Don’t think about all of the things you have to do later or worry about how much you’re being judged; think about something that makes you smile, or nothing at all.<p>
					     <h1>Step 9</h1>
					     <p>Be smarter about doing less. If you're lazy, then the choice is simple. Do less. But do it smartly: the lazy person makes every second count when they're doing something. If the action isn't going to count, isn't going to shave time off and free you up sooner, then either don't do it, or work out how it can be done in a way that does lessen the time and pain of input to allow you to do less. Here are some ways to do it:<p>
					     <h1>Step 10</h1>
					     <p>Simplify your life. Own less clothes, less cars, less stuff, less anything that needs maintenance, time, attention and elbow grease. Make an effort to donate or give away the clothes you no longer wear, to clean out your kitchen cabinets, to make your social schedule less hectic, and just to make your life easier whenever you can. Though this will take more effort up front, it will leave you time for more laziness later on<p>
